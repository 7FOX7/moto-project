When adding a new Route you have to make sure that you do everything below step by step: 

1. In your 'pages' folder - add a new page; 
2. Import the page to the 'App.jsx'
3. Inside 'theme.js', add the name of the route that you have just added (consider 'palette' and 'typography')
4. Add the Outermost Box (if any) to the 'style.js', like you did with the 'OnboardingBox'
5. DON'T store the Interactive content inside the 'route'. Add a new component 'Main' and add ALL the relevant content there
